# Laundry-Notification-App

## Executive Summary
Are you so busy that you forget to switch your laundry around?  Do you find yourself having to re-wash clean laundry because it has sat in the washing machine too long?  The Laundry Notification App is here to help!  This app uses a sensor that can be attached to the outside of your washing machine.  The sensor detects when the machine starts and when it has completed.  Once complete, the app notifies you via text message that the laundry is ready to be switched so that you never have to re-wash a load of laundry again!

## Project Goals
* Use a MetaWear sensor to detect when the washing machine starts, stops, and is unloaded
* Connect to a mobile app with the capability to send text message reminders
* Send text messages when the washing machine is finished running and follow-ups if the laundry is not unloaded
